# Protein_protein_interface_analysis
## This is a repository where we will import all the different important documents for our exercice, the group will be formed by:  Iris Mestres, Pablo Pérez, Ian Perez.


### There are different codes within those there are the following and contains:
- Energyevaluation: has a py code with formulas of Vdw, electrostatics and solvation also for the constants.
- The 6m0j fixed which are files of  basically the pdb with the proper units and the proper way of working
- Structure_interface   are  pymol sesions saved which will show you the interface graphically (avaluated for strictly 6 Armstrongs.)
    - Which Wcode corresponds to one which contains directly a script nin order to detect it fully correct
    - The code it's saved inside : Experimental_codepymol.py
- Basic_setup it's a python code which will do teh basic setup code, where it becomes  analysed for the enegry for each atom of the interfase, and gets the value of the total interface
- pairsInDistance(1): python script which gives a different set of different chains and decide the  ones which participate in the interficie.
