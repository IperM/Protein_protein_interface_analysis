### There are different codes within those there are the following and contains:

- Structure_interface   it is a pymol sesion saved which will show you the interface graphically (avaluated for strictly 6 Armstrongs.)
- Basic_setup it's a python code which will do teh basic setup code, where it becomes  analysed for the enegry for each atom of the interfase, and gets the value of the total interface
